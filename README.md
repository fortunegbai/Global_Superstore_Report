![](Cover_image.png)

## Introduction:

This is my final project with Digitaley Drive, featuring a Power BI project on the analysis of product and profit performance for an imaginary store called “Global Superstore”. Global Superstore is an online retailer based in New York, United States of America, with the sole purpose of becoming a one-stop shop for its customers from 147 countries. Its broad product catalogue comprises more than 10,000 products spanning three major categories: office supplies (e.g., staples), furniture (e.g., chairs), and technology (e.g., smartphones). 

_Disclaimer_: _The dataset used for this project is entirely fictional. Any resemblance to real individuals, organizations, countries, or events is coincidental and unintentional._

## Business Objective: 

To optimize performance and improve profitability.

## Problem Statement:
1a: What are the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore in 2014?

 b: For each of these three countries, find the three products with the highest total profit. Specifically, what are the products’ names and the total profit for each product?
 
2: Identify the 3 subcategories with the highest average shipping cost in the United States.
 
3a: Assess Nigeria’s profitability (i.e., total profit) for 2014. How does it compare to other African countries? 

 b: What factors might be responsible for Nigeria’s poor performance? You might want to investigate shipping costs and the average discount as potential root causes.

4a: Identify the product subcategory that is the least profitable in Southeast Asia. Note: For this question, assume that Southeast Asia comprises Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar 
    (Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.

 b: Is there a specific country in Southeast Asia where Global Superstore should stop offering the subcategory identified in 4a?

5: Which city is the least profitable (in terms of average profit) in the United States? For this analysis, discard the cities with less than 10 Orders. 

 b: Why is this city’s average profit so low?

6: Which product subcategory has the highest average profit in Australia?

7: Who are the most valuable customers and what do they purchase?
